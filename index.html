                    Hi! My name is Ryan and I build awesome things on the internet. Back in 2008, I played with custom MySpace themes - which was my introduction into HTML & CSS! 
                    When I get older I dabbled in a few introductory coding courses during my undergrad years at ASU. Today, I consider myself a life long learner and am pursuing my passion in web development.
                    I've had the wonderful opportunity in studying fullstack development through ASU's Coding Bootcamp.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My focus these days is learning about and building coding projects, while also balancing a full-time position in the banking industry. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    During my freetime, I enjoy working out, spending quality time with my girlfriend and our dog, or grinding out stats on my Hardcore Ironman on Old School RuneScape (Ironman btw).
