                    Hi! My name is Ryan and I build awesome things on the internet. Back in 2008, I played with custom MySpace themes - which was my introduction into HTML & CSS! 
                    When I got older I dabbled in a few introductory coding courses during my undergrad years at ASU. Today, I consider myself a life long learner and am pursuing my passion in web development.
                    I've had the wonderful opportunity in studying fullstack development through ASU's Coding Bootcamp.
                </p>

                <p>
                    These days I focus on learning about and building coding projects, while also balancing a full-time position in the banking industry. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    During my freetime, I enjoy working out, spending quality time with my girlfriend and our dog, or grinding out stats on my Hardcore Ironman on Old School RuneScape (Ironman btw).

                    First webpage I built using source code provided by ASU's Coding Bootcamp. A basic study guide that serves as a resource covering key concepts and practical aspects of the introductory material.
                    Topics consist of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. It provides organized notes to help learners navigate and underestand each topic effectively.

                    Bootcamp challenge with source code provided by ASU's Coding Bootcamp. Acting as consultant for a marketing agency, I was challenged with refactoring the existing site to make it more accessible.
                    Great introduction to semantic HTML, and helped me understand the functionality and impact of semantic HTML.

                    Mini project I created from scatch. Using HTML & CSS, I created a barebones test website. This project was super fun because I got to build this from the ground up, and expirement with the topics I've been learning!
